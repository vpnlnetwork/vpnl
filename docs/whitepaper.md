## Abstract

VPNL (Verifiable Performance Network Layer) is an open, credibly neutral data and verification layer designed to secure the Open Intents Framework (OIF) within Ethereum’s multi-chain ecosystem. It provides risk-adjusted routing by transforming solver performance data into verifiable, privacy-preserving reputation signals, enabling protocols to achieve capital efficiency without compromising safety or permissionlessness. This whitepaper outlines VPNL’s architecture, privacy model, governance framework, and interoperability roadmap, establishing it as a foundational public good for verifiable trust in decentralized coordination.

## 1. Introduction

Ethereum’s ecosystem is rapidly scaling across Layer 2 rollups and cross-chain protocols. This growth introduces new coordination risks: how can protocols safely and permissionlessly route user intents through third-party solvers entrusted with billions in capital?

The Open Intents Framework (OIF) enables intent-based coordination, where users specify outcomes instead of execution paths. Yet OIF faces a structural trilemma: maintaining **safety**, **permissionlessness**, and **capital efficiency** simultaneously is currently impossible with existing coordination mechanisms.

VPNL resolves this by providing the missing verifiable data layer: a decentralized system for quantifying solver trustworthiness, enabling risk-adjusted routing, and ensuring both liquidity efficiency and safety across the intent ecosystem.

### 1.1 Key Contributions

- Formalizes the OIF coordination trilemma and existing solution inadequacies
- Presents VPNL’s three-layer architecture (verification, performance, routing)
- Details privacy-preserving reputation via cryptographic commitments and ZK proofs
- Provides concrete integration examples for protocols, developers, and applications
- Outlines progressive decentralization governance path ensuring credible neutrality
- Demonstrates economic viability through capital efficiency modeling

## 2. The Interoperability Trilemma

### 2.1 The Fundamental Challenge

Without verifiable solver reputation, OIF protocols face an impossible choice:

|Condition             |Goal                   |Typical Solution       |Tradeoff            |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
|**Safety**            |Prevent fraud/default  |High collateral (100%+)|Capital inefficiency|
|**Permissionlessness**|Open solver access     |Remove whitelists      |Increased risk      |
|**Capital Efficiency**|Minimize locked capital|Trust select solvers   |Centralization      |

**The Trilemma:** Pick any two, sacrifice the third.

Current implementations demonstrate these tradeoffs:

- **Across Protocol:** Safe + Efficient → Centralized allowlist
- **Naive OIF:** Safe + Permissionless → 100% collateral requirement
- **Unverified:** Permissionless + Efficient → Unacceptable risk

### 2.2 Comparison to Existing Solutions

|Approach                   |Permissionless|Capital Efficient|Safe |Transparent|Example            |
|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------|-----|-----------|-------------------|
|**Centralized Allowlist**  |❌             |✅                |✅    |❌          |Across Protocol    |
|**Uniform 100% Collateral**|✅             |❌                |✅    |✅          |Naive baseline     |
|**No Verification**        |✅             |✅                |❌    |❌          |Unsustainable      |
|**KYC-Based Reputation**   |❌             |⚠️                |✅    |❌          |Traditional finance|
|**VPNL (Risk-Adjusted)**   |**✅**         |**✅**            |**✅**|**✅**      |**This paper**     |

#### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Centralized Allowlists (Across Protocol Model):**

- ✅ Achieves safety through manual curation of trusted solvers
- ✅ Capital efficient (verified solvers post minimal collateral)
- ❌ Sacrifices permissionlessness: new solvers face high barriers
- ❌ Opaque selection criteria create bottlenecks
- ❌ Does not scale: every protocol maintains separate allowlist

**Uniform Collateral Requirements:**

- ✅ Permissionless: anyone can participate by posting collateral
- ✅ Safe: 100% collateral eliminates default risk
- ❌ Capital inefficient: proven solvers locked into same requirements as unknowns
- ❌ Competitively disadvantages skilled but under-capitalized entrants
- ❌ Creates systemic liquidity constraints as network scales

**No Verification:**

- ✅ Maximally permissionless and capital efficient
- ❌ Unsafe: protocols exposed to fraud, default, manipulation
- ❌ Unsustainable: single bad actor can drain protocol reserves
- ❌ Users bear excessive risk, harming adoption

### 2.3 VPNL’s Resolution Strategy

VPNL introduces **verifiable but privacy-preserving performance data** as a coordination primitive, enabling:

1. **Permissionless participation:** Anyone can get verified by proving historical performance
1. **Capital efficiency:** Proven solvers post 70-85% less collateral
1. **Maintained safety:** Risk-adjusted requirements maintain solvency bounds
1. **Transparent standards:** Open schemas (W3C VCs, EAS) ensure auditability without revealing PII

**Core Insight:** Trust is not binary. By quantifying reliability along a continuous spectrum (scores 0-1), VPNL enables protocols to implement graduated risk management that is both efficient and safe.

-----

## 3. Economic Hypothesis

### 3.1 Capital Efficiency Model

VPNL’s value proposition rests on a quantifiable economic claim: **verifiable solver performance can unlock up to 45% capital efficiency gains** without sacrificing safety or permissionlessness.

**Risk-Adjusted Collateral Formula:**

Let C_max represent baseline collateral (100% of intent value) and S_i ∈ [0,1] the solver’s verifiable performance score. VPNL adjusts collateral requirements via:

```
C_i = C_max × (1 - α × S_i)
```

Where:

- **α ∈ [0,1]:** Tunable risk-weight parameter (default α = 0.8)
- **S_i:** Solver i’s reputation score (0 = unverified, 1 = perfect)
- **C_i:** Required collateral for solver i

**Network Efficiency Metric:**

```
η = (C_baseline - ΣC_i) / C_baseline
```

Where:

- **C_baseline = n × C_max:** Total collateral under uniform policy
- **ΣC_i:** Sum of risk-adjusted collateral across n solvers
- **η:** Proportional capital freed (efficiency gain)

### 3.2 Empirical Validation

**Baseline Scenario:** 100 solvers, $100k average intent value

**Without VPNL (Uniform Policy):**

- All solvers post 100% collateral
- Total locked: 100 × $100k = **$10M**

**With VPNL (Risk-Adjusted, α=0.8):**

Assuming realistic solver distribution (30/40/30 Expert/Advanced/Emerging):

|Tier    |Score   |Collateral|Count|Total |
|--------|--------|----------|-----|------|
|Expert  |S ≥ 0.85|15% ($15k)|30   |$450k |
|Advanced|S ≈ 0.65|50% ($50k)|40   |$2M   |
|Emerging|S ≈ 0.30|85% ($85k)|30   |$2.55M|

**Total locked: $5.45M**

**Result:** η ≈ 0.45 → **45% efficiency gain** → **$4.55M freed capital**

This freed capital can:

- Route additional user intents simultaneously
- Enable under-capitalized but skilled solvers to compete
- Improve prices for users through increased competition
- Scale liquidity across the ecosystem without proportional capital lockup

-----

## 4. System Architecture

VPNL operates across three interoperable layers, each serving a distinct function while maintaining composability:

### 4.1 Layer 1: Verification Layer

**Purpose:** Accurately verify solver performance without exposing PII

**Components:**

- Exchange API connectors (CEX: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.)
- DEX transaction analyzer (on-chain PnL calculation)
- Performance metric calculator (Sharpe ratio, win rate, drawdown)
- Cryptographic commitment generator

**Process:**

1. Solver connects exchange account (OAuth or read-only API key)
1. System fetches historical trade data (off-chain)
1. Calculate performance metrics over verification period (typically 90-180 days)
1. Generate commitment: `commitment = H(score || salt || metadata || timestamp)`
1. Store commitment hash on-chain, raw data remains off-chain (encrypted)

**Privacy Guarantee:** Raw PnL data NEVER touches blockchain

### 4.2 Layer 2: On-Chain Registry

**Purpose:** Immutable, queryable record of verifications

**Smart Contract:** `VPNLRegistry.sol` deployed on Arbitrum

**Data Structure:**

```solidity
struct Verification {
    bytes32 commitmentHash;    // Keccak256(score || salt || metadata)
    uint256 verifiedAt;        // UNIX timestamp
    uint256 expiresAt;         // Expiration timestamp
    bool active;               // Current status
    bool revoked;              // Revocation flag
    string revokeReason;       // Public justification if revoked
}
```

**Core Functions:**

- `verify(address, bytes32, uint256)` - Register new verification
- `revoke(address, string)` - Revoke for fraud/staleness
- `isVerified(address)` - Quick boolean status check
- `getVerification(address)` - Full verification details

**Events:**

- `Verified(address solver, bytes32 hash, uint256 timestamp)`
- `Revoked(address solver, string reason, uint256 timestamp)`

These events are indexed by The Graph subgraph for efficient querying.

### 4.3 Layer 3: Portable Credentials

**Purpose:** Solver-controlled, portable reputation

**Format:** W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0

**Issuance Flow:**

1. Solver completes verification (Layer 1)
1. Commitment hash stored on-chain (Layer 2)
1. VPNL issues W3C VC to solver’s wallet (self-sovereign identity)
1. Solver presents VC to protocols as needed

**Optional Enhancements:**

- EAS attestation (public discoverability on attestation explorer)
- ENS text records (integrate reputation with ENS profiles)
- SIWE authentication (wallet-based access control)

**Credential Schema:**

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "SolverReputationCredential"],
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:pkh:eip155:42161:0x...",
    "vpnlScore": 0.85,
    "tier": "Expert",
    "verifiedAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "expiresAt": "2025-07-01T00:00:00Z",
    "commitmentHash": "0x9a3f2b1c..."
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019",
    "created": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "verificationMethod": "did:pkh:eip155:42161:0x...",
    "jws": "eyJhbGci..."
  }
}
```

### 4.4 Data Flow

```
Solver → Verification Service (off-chain)
         ↓
     [Performance calculation]
         ↓
     Cryptographic commitment
         ↓
     VPNLRegistry.sol (Arbitrum)
         ↓

     The Graph indexes
         ↓
     API serves data
         ↓
     Protocol queries → Risk-adjusted routing decision
```

### 4.5 Privacy Model

VPNL’s architecture ensures solver privacy while maintaining verifiability—a critical balance for adoption in pseudonymous DeFi environments.

#### 4.5.1 Three-Tier Data Classification

**Tier 1: Private (Off-Chain Only)**

Never published:

- Raw trading data (individual trades, timestamps, order books)
- Absolute PnL histories (USD or crypto profit/loss amounts)
- Exchange API credentials (OAuth tokens, API keys)
- Geographic location, IP addresses, device fingerprints
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

Storage: Encrypted databases, access-controlled by solver, deletable on request  
Compliance: GDPR-compatible “right to be forgotten”

**Tier 2: Committed (On-Chain, Hashed)**

Published as cryptographic commitment:

- `commitment = H(score || salt || metadata || timestamp)`
- Keccak256 hash stored in `VPNLRegistry.sol`
- Original values never revealed on-chain
- Verification method: Zero-knowledge proofs of score range (Phase 2)

Properties:

- Immutable (cannot be altered post-commitment)
- Non-reversible (hash reveals no information about score)
- Verifiable (solver can prove commitment matches credential)
- Timestamped (prevents backdating)

**Tier 3: Public (On-Chain, Plaintext)**

Published transparently:

- Verification status (active/revoked boolean)
- Expiration timestamp (UNIX time)
- Revocation reason (if applicable, e.g., “Fraud detected”)
- Credential issuance transaction hash

Rationale: Protocols need real-time queryability of verification status without accessing private performance data.

#### 4.5.2 Zero-Knowledge Enhancements (Phase 2)

VPNL will implement ZK-SNARKs for selective disclosure:

**Range Proofs:**

```
Prove: score > 0.80 (Expert tier eligibility)
Without revealing: Exact score (e.g., 0.87)
```

**Threshold Proofs:**

```
Prove: collateral_required < $20k
Without revealing: Exact score or calculation
```

**Specialty Proofs:**

```
Prove: "Experienced in cross-chain arbitrage"
Without revealing: Trade count, specific venues, or PnL
```

Technical implementation:

- Groth16 or PLONK proof systems (EVM-compatible)
- Recursive composition for multiple simultaneous claims
- Verification gas cost target: <100k (economically viable)

#### 4.5.3 Data Retention Policy

**Off-Chain (Tier 1):**

- Retained for duration of verification validity (typically 180 days)
- Automatically deleted 30 days after expiration unless solver renews
- Solver can request immediate deletion (purged within 7 days)

**On-Chain (Tier 2 & 3):**

- Immutable: Commitments and status remain permanently
- Justification: Protocols require historical accountability
- Mitigation: Only hashes stored, no reversibility to private data

### 4.6 Protocol Integration Examples

#### 4.6.1 Smart Contract Integration

**Solidity Implementation:**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IVPNLRegistry {
    function getReputation(address solver) 
        external view returns (uint256 score, bool active, uint256 expiresAt);
}

contract IntentRouter {
    IVPNLRegistry public vpnlRegistry;
    uint256 public constant BASELINE_COLLATERAL_BPS = 10000; // 100%
    uint256 public constant RISK_WEIGHT_BPS = 8000; // α = 0.8
    
    constructor(address _vpnlRegistry) {
        vpnlRegistry = IVPNLRegistry(_vpnlRegistry);
    }
    
    function calculateRequiredCollateral(
        address solver,
        uint256 intentValue
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 score, bool active, uint256 expiresAt) = 
            vpnlRegistry.getReputation(solver);
        
        // Check validity
        if (!active || block.timestamp > expiresAt) {
            return intentValue; // Unverified: 100% collateral
        }
        
        // Risk-adjusted: C = C_max * (1 - α * S)
        // Score stored as 0-1000, so divide by 1000
        uint256 reduction = (intentValue * RISK_WEIGHT_BPS * score) 
            / (BASELINE_COLLATERAL_BPS * 1000);
        
        return intentValue - reduction;
    }
}
```

#### 4.6.2 TypeScript SDK Integration

```typescript
import { VPNLClient } from '@vpnl/sdk';

const vpnl = new VPNLClient({
  network: 'arbitrum',
  registryAddress: '0x...',
  provider: ethersProvider
});

// Query reputation
const rep = await vpnl.getReputation(solverAddress);
console.log(`Score: ${rep.score}, Tier: ${rep.tier}`);

// Calculate collateral
const intentValue = ethers.parseEther("100");
const required = await vpnl.calculateCollateral(solverAddress, intentValue);
console.log(`Required: ${ethers.formatEther(required)} ETH`);
```

## 5. Governance and Progressive Decentralization

VPNL follows a three-phase governance evolution ensuring credible neutrality while maintaining operational security:

### 5.1 Phase 1: Centralized Verification (Current)

**Duration:** Months 1-2 (Q1 2025)  
**Authority:** Founder-controlled verification service  
**Rationale:** Accuracy and rapid iteration during prototype phase

**Safeguards:**

- All verification logic is transparent and auditable (open source)
- Verification decisions logged on-chain with justification
- Community can review and contest decisions
- Clear transition timeline published

**Risk:** Single point of control  
**Mitigation:** Transparent processes, short duration, community oversight

### 5.2 Phase 2: Multisig Governance (Q2-Q3 2025)

**Duration:** Months 3-6  
**Authority:** 3-of-5 multisig with geographically distributed, reputation-staked signers  
**Scope:** Parameter adjustments (α, β), dispute resolution, emergency actions

**Governed Parameters:**

|Parameter          |Symbol    |Default |Description                        |
|-------------------|----------|--------|-----------------------------------|
|Risk weight        |α         |0.80    |Collateral reduction aggressiveness|
|Memory decay       |β         |0.90    |Recent vs. historical weighting    |
|Expert threshold   |S_expert  |0.80    |Minimum score for top tier         |
|Advanced threshold |S_advanced|0.60    |Minimum score for mid tier         |
|Verification period|T_valid   |180 days|Verification validity duration     |

**Change Process:**

1. Proposal submitted with rationale
1. 14-day community comment period
1. 3-of-5 signers vote on-chain
1. If approved: 7-day time-lock before execution
1. Emergency override: 4-of-5 for critical vulnerabilities

**Risk:** Signer collusion  
**Mitigation:** Geographic distribution, public transparency, community nomination process

### 5.3 Phase 3: DAO Governance (Q4 2025+)

**Duration:** Months 6+ (long-term)  
**Authority:** Community-governed DAO with token or reputation-weighted voting  
**Scope:** All parameters, schema updates, treasury management

**Governance Features:**

- Quadratic voting for high-impact parameters (α, β thresholds)
- 30-day time-lock for non-emergency changes
- Constitutional limits hardcoded (e.g., α_max = 0.9, β_min = 0.7)
- Community verifier onboarding (decentralized verification)
- Emergency multisig override retained for critical security issues

**Long-Term Vision:** Self-sustaining, community-governed public goods infrastructure analogous to Ethereum protocol governance.
