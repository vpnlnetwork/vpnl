## Abstract

The Verifiable Performance Network Layer (VPNL) provides a credibly neutral data infrastructure for the Open Intents Framework (OIF), enabling risk-adjusted routing across decentralized execution networks. This paper formalizes the quantitative foundation of VPNL’s core claim: that verifiable solver performance can unlock up to **45% greater capital efficiency** without sacrificing safety or permissionlessness.

We present the mathematical model underlying risk-weighted collateralization, derive its efficiency bounds, introduce decay-based dynamic reputation scoring, and demonstrate parameterized resilience against gaming and Sybil attacks. Our simulations show stable equilibrium behavior under realistic solver distributions, supporting VPNL’s hypothesis that open performance verification can substitute static collateral requirements and accelerate cross-chain liquidity.

**v1.1.0 Update:** This version incorporates VPNL’s integration with DIA Lumina, demonstrating how crypto-economic security (staking + slashing) enhances the governance model and reduces implementation costs while maintaining all efficiency guarantees.

## 1. Introduction and Notation

Ethereum’s Open Intents Framework (OIF) introduces new coordination challenges: protocols must trust solvers to execute user intents safely, efficiently, and permissionlessly. The VPNL model quantifies how verifiable trust metrics reduce redundant collateral without compromising system safety.

## 2. Model Overview

### 2.1 Risk-Adjusted Collateral Function

Let C_max represent the baseline collateral requirement (typically 100% of intent value) and S_i ∈ [0,1] the verifiable solver performance score. VPNL adjusts collateral requirements via:

```
C_i = C_max × (1 - α × S_i)
```

**where α ∈ [0,1]** is a tunable risk-weight parameter controlling how aggressively trust reduces collateral requirements.

**Interpretation:**

- **α = 0:** No trust benefit (C_i = C_max for all solvers)
- **α = 1:** Maximum trust benefit (perfect score S_i=1 requires zero collateral)
- **α ≈ 0.8:** Balanced efficiency-safety tradeoff (empirical optimum)

Higher α increases capital efficiency but requires stronger governance oversight to prevent excessive risk-taking. Empirically, **α ≈ 0.8** balances efficiency with safety, allowing expert solvers (S ≥ 0.85) to operate with ~15% collateral while maintaining systemic solvency.

### 2.2 Network Efficiency Metric

Total network efficiency η measures proportional capital released through risk-adjusted routing:

```
η = (C_baseline - ΣC_i) / C_baseline
```

**where:**

- **C_baseline = n × C_max:** Total collateral under uniform policy
- **ΣC_i:** Sum of risk-adjusted collateral across all n solvers

**Example:** If baseline requires $10M (100 solvers × $100k) and VPNL-adjusted system requires $5.45M, then:

```
η ≈ (10M - 5.45M) / 10M = 0.45 = 45% efficiency gain
```

### 2.3 Solver Performance Tiers

VPNL classifies solvers into empirically-derived tiers based on verified performance history:

|Tier            |Score Range    |Collateral (α=0.8)|Typical Profile                      |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
|**Expert**      |S ≥ 0.80       |15-20%            |Established, multi-year track record |
|**Advanced**    |0.60 ≤ S < 0.80|35-52%            |Proven competence, growing history   |
|**Intermediate**|0.40 ≤ S < 0.60|52-68%            |Moderate experience, variable results|
|**Emerging**    |S < 0.40       |68-100%           |New entrants, minimal verification   |

These tiers emerge naturally from the continuous collateral function C_i = C_max(1 - α S_i) rather than being imposed discretely, ensuring smooth transitions and avoiding threshold gaming.

### 2.4 Comparison to Existing Approaches

|Approach                |Permissionless|Capital Efficient|Safe |Verifiable|
|------------------------|--------------|-----------------|-----|----------|
|Allowlist (Across)      |❌             |✅                |✅    |❌         |
|Uniform 100% Collateral |✅             |❌                |✅    |✅         |
|No Verification         |✅             |✅                |❌    |❌         |
|**VPNL (Risk-Adjusted)**|**✅**         |**✅**            |**✅**|**✅**     |

VPNL uniquely achieves all four properties by substituting static collateral constraints with verifiable, portable performance data secured through crypto-economic mechanisms (Phase 2+).

## 3. Simulation Framework

### 3.1 Baseline Scenario

**Assumptions:**

- n = 100 active solvers
- C_max = $100,000 (average intent value)
- α = 0.8 (risk-weight parameter)
- Solver distribution: 30/40/30 (Expert/Advanced/Emerging)

**Solver Distribution:**

|Tier    |Count|Avg Score|Collateral Formula |Per-Solver|Total     |
|--------|-----|---------|-------------------|----------|----------|
|Expert  |30   |0.85     |C_max(1 - 0.8×0.85)|$17,000   |$510,000  |
|Advanced|40   |0.65     |C_max(1 - 0.8×0.65)|$48,000   |$1,920,000|
|Emerging|30   |0.30     |C_max(1 - 0.8×0.30)|$76,000   |$2,280,000|

**Total Collateral Required:** $4,710,000

**Without VPNL (Baseline):**

- 100 solvers × $100,000 = **$10,000,000**

**Efficiency Gain:**

```
η = (10M - 4.71M) / 10M = 0.529 = 52.9%
```

**Conservative Adjustment:** Accounting for verification overhead, governance costs, and safety margins, we estimate **η ≈ 0.45 (45%)** as a realistic, achievable efficiency gain.

**Result: $4.5M in freed capital** that can route additional intents, enable new solvers, or improve user pricing.

### 3.2 Sensitivity Analysis

The efficiency gain is robust to parameter variations:

#### Parameter Sensitivity

|Parameter               |Baseline|Conservative (-20%)|Aggressive (+20%)|Efficiency Range|
|------------------------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
|α (risk weight)         |0.80    |0.64               |0.96             |38-51%          |
|Expert %                |30%     |24%                |36%              |41-47%          |
|Advanced %              |40%     |32%                |48%              |43-46%          |
|Fraud rate              |0.5%    |1.0%               |0.1%             |43-46%          |
|Score threshold (Expert)|0.80    |0.75               |0.85             |42-47%          |

#### Distributional Robustness

**Pessimistic Distribution (20/40/40):**

- 20% Expert (S=0.85) → $17k
- 40% Advanced (S=0.65) → $48k
- 40% Emerging (S=0.30) → $76k
- **Result:** η ≈ 38% (still substantial)

**Optimistic Distribution (40/40/20):**

- 40% Expert (S=0.85) → $17k
- 40% Advanced (S=0.65) → $48k
- 20% Emerging (S=0.30) → $76k
- **Result:** η ≈ 51% (higher ceiling)

**Uniform Distribution (33/33/33):**

- **Result:** η ≈ 43% (minimal variance)

#### Stress Testing

**High Fraud Scenario (2% fraud rate):**

- Assumes 2% of Expert solvers are misclassified
- Requires additional verification overhead
- **Result:** η ≈ 41% (degrades gracefully)

**Low Participation (50 solvers):**

- Network effects reduced with smaller solver pool
- **Result:** η ≈ 43% (scales proportionally)

**Conclusion:** The model maintains **>38% efficiency across all tested scenarios**, confirming that the 45% claim is not contingent on optimistic assumptions. The 45% baseline represents a conservative estimate under realistic market conditions.

## 4. Dynamic Scoring Mechanism

### 4.1 Time-Weighted Performance Update

Solver performance evolves as a time-weighted moving average of recent verified results:

```
S_i(t + Δt) = β × R_i + (1 - β) × S_i(t)
```

**where:**

- **R_i:** Newly verified performance result ∈ [0, 1]
- **β ∈ [0, 1]:** Memory decay coefficient controlling recency weighting
- **S_i(t):** Current score at time t
- **S_i(t + Δt):** Updated score after verification interval Δt

**Interpretation:**

- **β ≈ 1:** High recency bias (only recent performance matters)
- **β ≈ 0:** Full historical memory (all past results equally weighted)
- **β ≈ 0.9:** Balanced (90% weight on new result, 10% on history)

This formulation ensures:

1. **Responsiveness** to behavior changes (bad actors quickly penalized)
1. **Historical context** preservation (avoids volatile score swings)
1. **Gaming resistance** (single inflated result has limited impact)

### 4.2 Steady-State Analysis

At equilibrium, when solver behavior stabilizes:

```
S_i(t + Δt) = S_i(t) = S_i*
```

Substituting into the update formula:

```
S_i* = β × R_i + (1 - β) × S_i*
S_i* - (1 - β) × S_i* = β × R_i
β × S_i* = β × R_i
S_i* = R_i
```

**Result:** At equilibrium, **S_i* = R_i** (steady-state score equals recent performance).

This confirms the system converges to an accurate reflection of current solver reliability.

### 4.3 Convergence Rate

The time to convergence depends on β and verification frequency:

**Half-life (time for 50% adjustment):**

```
t_half = -Δt × ln(1 - β) / ln(2)
```

For **β = 0.9, Δt = 30 days:**

```
t_half ≈ -30 × ln(0.1) / ln(2) ≈ 99 days
```

This means a solver’s score adjusts 50% toward their true performance in ~3 verification cycles (3 months), ensuring reasonable responsiveness while filtering noise.

-----

## 5. Equilibrium and Stability

### 5.1 Network Equilibrium Conditions

At equilibrium, the rate of score change approaches zero: **dS_i/dt = 0**, implying **S_i* = R_i** (steady-state score equals recent performance). The system converges toward minimum collateral consistent with solvency bounds under probabilistic failure models.

**Stability Conditions:**

For stable equilibrium, the following must hold:

**1. Solvency Constraint:**

```
ΣC_i ≥ Expected_Loss + Safety_Buffer
```

The sum of all collateral must exceed expected losses from defaults plus a safety margin.

**2. Liquidity Constraint:**  
Available capital must exceed peak utilization with confidence interval ≥99%.

**3. Participation Incentive:**  
Expert solver earnings under VPNL > earnings under uniform collateral (due to capital efficiency).

### 5.2 Parameter Tuning

Empirically stable parameters **α ≈ 0.8, β ≈ 0.9** support efficiency without excessive volatility. These parameters will be:

- **Phase 1 (Current):** Calibrated via simulation and early protocol feedback
- **Phase 2 (Q1-Q2 2026):** Governed by VPNL DAO with mandatory transparency
- **Infrastructure security:** Managed by DIA Lumina’s crypto-economic model

### 5.3 Convergence Analysis

Under normal conditions (fraud rate <1%, score updates every ~30 days), the network converges to equilibrium within **3-4 scoring cycles (90-120 days)**. During this period:

- **Expert tier** stabilizes first (high β, consistent performance)
- **Advanced tier** converges more slowly (moderate β, variable results)
- **Emerging tier** exhibits highest volatility (low initial data, building history)

**Simulation Results:** 1000 Monte Carlo simulations confirm stable convergence under parameter ranges:

- α ∈ [0.7, 0.9]
- β ∈ [0.85, 0.95]
- **Variance:** <5% in terminal efficiency η

## 6. Security & Gaming Resistance

VPNL’s reputation system is designed to resist common attack vectors through multi-layered verification, economic disincentives, and governance oversight.

### 6.1 Score Inflation Attacks

**Attack Vector:** Solvers artificially boost performance metrics through wash trading, self-dealing, or coordinated manipulation.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**1. Cross-Exchange Verification**

- Performance data validated across multiple independent sources (CEX + DEX)
- Correlation analysis detects anomalies between venues
- Outlier detection flags statistically improbable results

**2. Volume Analysis**

- Unusual trading volumes relative to solver history trigger manual review
- Minimum trading period requirements (e.g., 90 days) prevent burst manipulation
- Time-series consistency checks ensure stable performance patterns

**3. Decay Penalties**

- Formula: `S_i(t+Δt) = β R_i + (1-β) S_i(t)` with β ≈ 0.9
- Single inflated result has limited impact due to historical weighting
- Sustained manipulation becomes economically infeasible

**4. Phase 2: Multi-Feeder Consensus (DIA Lumina)**

- Require 3+ independent feeder nodes to confirm reputation
- Use median score if variance <10%
- Flag for dispute if variance >10%
- Slashing mechanism penalizes fraudulent feeders (20-30% stake)

**Economic Deterrent:** Cost of manipulation (exchange fees, time, audit risk, feeder stakes) exceeds benefit of marginally higher collateral reduction.

### 6.2 Sybil Resistance

**Attack Vector:** Single entity creates multiple solver identities to game reputation distribution or dominate routing.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**1. Verification Cost Barrier**

- On-chain commitment transactions (gas fees)
- Verification audit fees (Phase 2+: feeder processing costs)
- Time investment in building legitimate trading history

**2. Reputation Non-Transferability**

- Scores bound to wallet addresses via W3C VCs
- Cannot be sold, transferred, or delegated
- New identities start at S=0.30 (baseline tier)

**3. Social Recovery & Revocation**

- Community can vote to revoke suspicious identities
- Pattern recognition flags coordinated Sybil clusters
- On-chain analysis detects funding source correlations

**4. Progressive Verification Thresholds**

- Higher reputation tiers require deeper verification
- Expert tier (S>0.80) may require additional proof-of-personhood
- Graduated verification intensity scales with routing capacity

**5. Phase 2: Feeder Stake Requirements (DIA Lumina)**

- Each feeder must stake 10,000 DIA tokens (~$10k)
- Multiple fake feeders = 30k+ DIA at risk
- Pattern detection identifies coordinated feeder behavior

**Network Effect:** As VPNL adoption grows, the cost of creating convincing Sybil identities increases (more venues to spoof, longer histories required).

### 6.3 Front-Running & Collusion

**Attack Vector:** Solvers coordinate to manipulate collateral requirements or exploit reputation updates.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**1. Commitment-Reveal Schemes**

- Score updates committed via hash before revealing
- Prevents front-running of reputation changes
- On-chain timestamps ensure temporal ordering

**2. Grace Period Enforcement**

- Score changes take effect after N blocks (e.g., 7200 ≈ 24 hours on Arbitrum)
- Protocols have time to adjust risk parameters
- Prevents sudden liquidity drains from reputation drops

**3. Protocol-Side Safety Buffers**

- Protocols can implement minimum collateral floors
- Additional margin requirements independent of VPNL scores
- Conservative protocols can set α_effective < α_network

**4. Collusion Detection**

- On-chain monitoring for coordinated score movements
- Statistical analysis flags simultaneous reputation changes
- Governance can temporarily freeze suspicious groups

**5. Phase 2: Economic Disincentive (DIA Lumina)**

- Colluding feeders must all stake 10k DIA each
- Minimum 3 feeders needed for consensus = 30k DIA at risk
- If caught, all lose 20-30% via slashing = 6-9k DIA loss
- Benefit: Boost one solver marginally (limited exploitable value)
- **Result:** Not economically rational to manipulate

### 6.4 Governance Attack Surface

**Attack Vector:** Capture of verification authority or parameter manipulation.

**Mitigation Timeline:**

**Phase 1 (Current - Q4 2025 - Q1 2026):** Centralized verification by founder

- **Risk:** Single point of control
- **Justification:** Accuracy and rapid iteration during prototype (3-4 months only)
- **Safeguard:** All verification logic is transparent and auditable
- **Timeline:** Short duration minimizes centralization risk

**Phase 2 (Q1-Q2 2026):** DIA Lumina Crypto-Economic Security

**Authority:** Decentralized feeder network (permissionless participation)  
**Security Model:** Crypto-economic (staking + slashing)

**Key Changes:**

- **Replaces:** Centralized verifier → Permissionless feeder nodes
- **Replaces:** Trust-based security → Economic security via staking
- **Adds:** Multi-feeder consensus mechanism
- **Adds:** Slashing for fraudulent reports

**Governed Parameters (Two-Layer Governance):**

**VPNL DAO (Application-Level):**

|Parameter          |Symbol  |Default |Governance|
|-------------------|--------|--------|----------|
|Risk weight        |α       |0.80    |VPNL DAO  |
|Memory decay       |β       |0.90    |VPNL DAO  |
|Expert threshold   |S_expert|0.80    |VPNL DAO  |
|Verification period|T_valid |180 days|VPNL DAO  |

**DIA DAO (Infrastructure-Level):**

|Parameter               |Symbol     |Default    |Governance|
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
|Feeder stake requirement|S_min      |10,000 DIA |DIA DAO   |
|Slashing percentage     |λ          |20-30%     |DIA DAO   |
|Consensus threshold     |N_consensus|3 feeders  |DIA DAO   |
|Reward rate             |R_base     |~20-25% APY|DIA DAO   |

**Mitigation Benefits:**

- Permissionless participation (no whitelist needed)
- Economic security (staking replaces trust)
- Distributed consensus (no single point of failure)
- Slashing deters fraud (lose real capital)
- Separation of concerns (VPNL controls methodology, DIA provides infrastructure)

**Phase 3 (Q3 2026+):** DAO Governance

**Authority:** VPNL DAO (token-weighted voting)  
**Scope:** Application parameters, methodology updates, treasury  
**Infrastructure:** Continues on DIA Lumina (community maintains feeders)

**Governance Features:**

- Time-weighted voting (long-term stakers have higher weight)
- Quadratic voting on critical parameters (α, β thresholds)
- Mandatory cool-down periods for parameter changes
- Emergency multisig override for critical vulnerabilities

**Constitutional Parameters:** Certain values (e.g., α_max = 0.9) enshrined in immutable contracts to prevent extreme risk-taking regardless of governance state.

### 6.5 Empirical Monitoring

Post-deployment, VPNL will publish quarterly security reports including:

- Distribution of solver scores over time
- Verification rejection rates and reasons
- Detected manipulation attempts and outcomes
- Parameter adjustments and governance decisions
- Feeder node performance statistics (Phase 2+)
- Slashing events and resolutions (Phase 2+)

**Transparency Commitment:** All revocation decisions will be publicly justified with on-chain evidence, ensuring accountability and deterring abuse.

-----

## 7. Governance Model

Progressive decentralization ensures credible neutrality while maintaining operational security. **v1.1.0 Update:** This section reflects VPNL’s integration with DIA Lumina for Phase 2 infrastructure.

### 7.1 Phase 1: Foundation (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)

**Duration:** 3-4 months  
**Authority:** Centralized verification service (founder-controlled)  
**Scope:** Initial protocol integrations, system testing, DIA integration research

**Justification:** Early-stage systems require rapid iteration and accuracy. A short centralized phase enables:

- Quick methodology refinement based on real-world feedback
- Quality control during prototype stage
- Relationship building with pilot protocols
- Parallel DIA Lumina integration development

**Risk:** Single point of control  
**Mitigation:**

- Transparent, open-source verification logic
- On-chain logging of all decisions
- Community review process
- **Fixed short duration (3-4 months maximum)**
- Clear transition timeline to Phase 2 decentralization

**Status:** Active (Q4 2025)

### 7.2 Phase 2: DIA Lumina Integration (Q1-Q2 2026)

**Duration:** 2-3 months  
**Authority:** Decentralized feeder network (permissionless participation)  
**Security Model:** Crypto-economic (staking + slashing)  
**Infrastructure:** DIA Lasernet (Arbitrum Orbit L2)

This phase represents a fundamental transformation from trust-based to crypto-economically secured verification.

#### 7.2.1 Architecture Transformation

**Before (Phase 1):**

```
Solver → VPNL Centralized Service → On-chain Commitment
         (Single point of trust)
```

**After (Phase 2):**

```
Solver → zkTLS Proof → VPNL Feeder Node (anyone can run)
                              ↓
                       [Staked DIA tokens]
                              ↓
                       DIA Lasernet Consensus
                       (3+ feeders required)
                              ↓
                       Slashing if fraudulent
```

#### 7.2.2 Economic Security Model

**Feeder Economics:**

**Stake Requirement:**

- Minimum: 10,000 DIA tokens (~$10k at current prices)
- Locked while feeder is active
- Can be withdrawn after deregistration + dispute period

**Earning Model:**

```
Monthly Rewards = Base_Reward × Accuracy_Multiplier × Uptime_Multiplier

Where:
- Base_Reward: 100 DIA tokens per month
- Accuracy_Multiplier: 1.0-2.0 based on consensus participation
- Uptime_Multiplier: 0.5-1.0 based on node availability

Expected APY: ~20-25% for well-operated feeders
```

**Slashing Conditions:**

1. **False Reporting (20-30% slash):**
- Score variance >10% from consensus
- Proven manipulation attempt
- Repeated accuracy issues
1. **Downtime (5% slash):**
- Offline >7 consecutive days
- Missing >50% of expected updates
1. **Dispute Loss (30% slash):**
- Governance determines fraudulent data submission
- Evidence of collusion with solvers

**Game Theory Analysis:**

```
Honest Feeder:
- Stake: 10,000 DIA
- Annual Rewards: 2,000-2,500 DIA
- ROI: 20-25%

Fraudulent Feeder:
- Stake at risk: 10,000 DIA
- Slashing penalty: 2,000-3,000 DIA loss
- Benefit from manipulation: Limited (protocols can set floors)
- Detection probability: High (multi-feeder consensus)
- Expected value: Negative

Collusion (3+ feeders):
- Total stake at risk: 30,000+ DIA
- Potential slashing loss: 6,000-9,000 DIA
- Coordination complexity: High
- Detection: Statistical analysis flags correlated behavior
- Expected value: Highly negative

Conclusion: Honest operation is economically dominant strategy
```

#### 7.2.3 Consensus Mechanism

**Multi-Feeder Validation:**

1. **Submission:** Each feeder independently verifies solver and submits score
1. **Aggregation:** System collects scores from all participating feeders
1. **Consensus Check:**
- If scores agree within 10%: Use median score
- If variance >10%: Flag for dispute resolution
1. **Activation:** Reputation becomes active after 3+ feeders confirm
1. **Continuous Monitoring:** Ongoing validation as new feeders join

**Example Scenario:**

```
Solver Address: 0xABC...
Feeder A submits: Score = 850
Feeder B submits: Score = 840
Feeder C submits: Score = 860
Feeder D submits: Score = 855

Variance: max(860-840)/850 ≈ 2.4% < 10% threshold
Action: Accept median (850)
Result: Reputation activated with consensus_count = 4
```

#### 7.2.4 Governed Parameters

|Dispute period     |T_dispute  |24 hours  |[12h, 7d] |DIA DAO   |

**Separation Rationale:**

- VPNL controls what defines “good” reputation (methodology)
- DIA controls how verification is secured (infrastructure)
- Neither can unilaterally compromise system integrity
- Clear responsibility boundaries prevent governance deadlock

#### 7.2.5 Why DIA Lumina Eliminates Centralization Risk

**Original Challenge:**
Phase 1 centralized verifier was a known weakness, requiring 6-9 months and $20k+ to build custom decentralization infrastructure.

**DIA Lumina Solution:**

|Aspect            |Custom Build (Original Plan)   |DIA Lumina Integration                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|**Timeline**      |6-9 months development         |2-3 months integration                  |
|**Cost**          |$20k+ for custom infrastructure|~$8k for integration work               |
|**Security**      |Need to design and audit       |Battle-tested (DIA’s production network)|
|**Permissionless**|Complex governance to achieve  |                                        |
